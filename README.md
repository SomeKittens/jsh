Embedded dev tools.

It's coming.

Nothing works yet, just numbers and booleans really.

I'm too tired to write something here.

It's horrible an bloated, I know. It'll be better. Maybe. Yes. Definitely.

## License
99% of the files here have a giant license block at the top. Basically, it's
directly from the dev tools source. This goes for any images in `css/Images`.

Favicon is from github's [Octicon](https://octicons.github.com/) set. Expect a
new one.

Any code *I* write is under the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/).
